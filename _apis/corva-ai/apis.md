  The Corva API is a powerful interface providing great flexibility and
  extensibility with Corva. Whether your needs are simple UI visualizations,
  data entry, replication/sync tasks, real-time stream processing, or complex
  machine learning CPU-intensive apps, the Corva API is the way to make it
  happen. Our concepts are split into three distinct silos: data apps,
  visualization apps, and a REST API ~
