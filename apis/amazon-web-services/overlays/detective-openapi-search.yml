        account that is enabling Detective.</p> <p>Before you try to enable
        Detective, make sure that your account has been enrolled in Amazon
        GuardDuty for at least 48 hours. If you do not meet this requirement,
        you cannot enable Detective. If you do meet the GuardDuty prerequisite,
        then when you make the request to enable Detective, it checks whether
        your data volume is within the Detective quota. If it exceeds the quota,
        then you cannot enable Detective. </p> <p>The operation also enables
        Detective for the calling account in the currently selected Region. It

        data tables for the new behavior graph.</p> <p>An account can only be
        the administrator account for one behavior graph within a Region. If the

        <p> <code>CreateMembers</code> is used to send invitations to accounts.
        For the organization behavior graph, the Detective administrator account
        uses <code>CreateMembers</code> to enable organization accounts as
        member accounts.</p> <p>For invited accounts, <code>CreateMembers</code>
        sends a request to invite the specified Amazon Web Services accounts to
        be member accounts in the behavior graph. This operation can only be
        called by the administrator account for a behavior graph. </p> <p>
        <code>CreateMembers</code> verifies the accounts and then invites the
        verified accounts. The administrator can optionally specify to not send
        invitation emails to the member accounts. This would be used when the
        administrator manages their member accounts centrally.</p> <p>For
        organization accounts in the organization behavior graph,
        <code>CreateMembers</code> attempts to enable the accounts. The
        organization accounts do not receive invitations.</p> <p>The request
        provides the behavior graph ARN and the list of accounts to invite or to
        enable.</p> <p>The response separates the requested accounts into two
        lists:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The accounts that <code>CreateMembers</code> was
        able to process. For invited accounts, includes member accounts that are
        being verified, that have passed verification and are to be invited, and
        that have failed verification. For organization accounts in the
        organization behavior graph, includes accounts that can be enabled and
        that cannot be enabled.</p> </li> <li> <p>The accounts that
        <code>CreateMembers</code> was unable to process. This list includes
        accounts that were already invited to be member accounts in the behavior
        graph.</p> </li> </ul>
