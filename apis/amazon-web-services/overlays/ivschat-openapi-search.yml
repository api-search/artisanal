        <p>Creates an encrypted token that is used by a chat participant to
        establish an individual WebSocket chat connection to a room. When the
        token is used to connect to chat, the connection is valid for the
        session duration specified in the request. The token becomes invalid at
        the token-expiration timestamp included in the response.</p> <p>Use the
        <code>capabilities</code> field to permit an end user to send messages
        or moderate a room.</p> <p>The <code>attributes</code> field securely
        attaches structured data to the chat session; the data is included
        within each message sent by the end user and received by other
        participants in the room. Common use cases for attributes include
        passing end-user profile data like an icon, display name, colors,

        Amazon IVS Chat and never used directly by your application.</p>
