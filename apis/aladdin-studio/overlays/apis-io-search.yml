description: >-
  Aladdin Studio APIs enable you to build your own solutions with access to the
  breadth and depth of Aladdin data and capabilities. Retrieve, write, and
  modify data from across the Aladdin ecosystem to power proprietary
  applications and create custom tools that meet your needs. It appears that you
  have to submit form to get acess to anything, so there really isn't much to
  profile without obtaining more access.
