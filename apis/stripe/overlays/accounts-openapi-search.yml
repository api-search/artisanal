        <p>With <a href="/docs/connect">Connect</a>, you can create Stripe
        accounts for your users.

        To do this, you’ll first need to <a
        href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings">register
        your platform</a>.</p>


        <p>If you’ve already collected information for your connected accounts,
        you <a href="/docs/connect/best-practices#onboarding">can prefill that
        information</a> when

        creating the account. Connect Onboarding won’t ask for the prefilled
        information during account onboarding.

        You can prefill any information on the account.</p>
