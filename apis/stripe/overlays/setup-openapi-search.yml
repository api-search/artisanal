        when a customer hits the “Save” button on a payment method management

        page on your website.</p>


        <p>If the selected payment method does not require any additional

        steps from the customer, the SetupIntent will transition to the

        <code>succeeded</code> status.</p>


        <p>Otherwise, it will transition to the <code>requires_action</code>
        status and

        suggest additional actions via <code>next_action</code>. If setup fails,

        the SetupIntent will transition to the

        <code>requires_payment_method</code> status or the <code>canceled</code>
        status if the

        confirmation limit is reached.</p>
