      summary: Create a terminal action
      description: >-
        Schedules a [terminal
        action](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/automating-terminal-management/terminal-actions-api)
        by specifying the action and the terminals that the action must be
        applied to. 


        The following restrictions apply:

        * You can schedule only one action at a time. For example, to install a
        new app version and remove an old app version, you have to make two API
        requests. 

        * The maximum number of terminals in a request is **100**. For example,
        to apply an action to 250 terminals, you have to divide the terminals
        over three API requests. 

        * If there is an error with one or more terminal IDs in the request, the
        action is scheduled for none of the terminals. You need to fix the error
        and try again.
