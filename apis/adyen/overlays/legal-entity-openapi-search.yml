        A transfer instrument is a bank account that a legal entity owns. Adyen
        performs verification checks on the transfer instrument as required by
        payment industry regulations. We inform you of the verification results
        through webhooks or API responses.

        start sending funds from the balance platform to the transfer instrument
        (such as payouts).
