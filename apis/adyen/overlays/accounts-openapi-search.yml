      description: >+
        Updates the `accountHolderDetails` and `processingTier` of an account
        holder, and adds bank accounts and shareholders.


        When updating `accountHolderDetails`, parameters that are not included
        in the request are left unchanged except for the following object:


        * `metadata`: Updating the metadata replaces the entire object. This
        means that to update an existing key-value pair, you must provide the
        changes, as well as other existing key-value pairs.


        When updating any field in the following objects, you must submit all
        the fields required for validation:

         * `address`

        * `fullPhoneNumber`


        * `bankAccountDetails.BankAccountDetail`


        * `businessDetails.shareholders.ShareholderContact`

         For example, to update the `address.postalCode`, you must also submit the `address.country`, `.city`, `.street`, `.postalCode`, and possibly `.stateOrProvince` so that the address can be validated.

        To add a bank account or shareholder, provide the bank account or
        shareholder details without a `bankAccountUUID` or a `shareholderCode`.
