        Starts a request to transfer funds to [balance
        accounts](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/balanceplatform/latest/post/balanceAccounts),
        [transfer
        instruments](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/legalentity/latest/post/transferInstruments),
        or third-party bank accounts. Adyen sends the outcome of the transfer
        request through webhooks.


        To use this endpoint, you need an additional role for your API
        credential and transfers must be enabled for the source balance account.
        Your Adyen contact will set these up for you.
