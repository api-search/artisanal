  - name: Walmart Feeds API
    description: >-
      Feeds are constructed to handle bulk functions. A feed consists of an HTTP
      request with an attached file. The attached file contains the XML
      representing the objects that need to be created or updated. The Walmart
      APIs version 3.0 supports only Item and Feed types. Refer to the bulk
      endpoints in each section to see example Feeds for each feed type. Once
      you upload the Feeds, you can use the Feed ID to track the status of the
      feeds and the status of the item within those Feeds.
