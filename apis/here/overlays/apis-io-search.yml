      RESTful web services that serve different purposes – from search, to
      geocoding, to routing. Whether you’re providing truck routing for fleets
      or navigating users through the city with different transport modes, HERE
      REST APIs provide you with everything you need to put location at the
      heart of your app: maps, weather information, batch geocoding,
      comprehensive routing and more. Additional advanced location features
      include geofencing (entry and exit notifications), custom and private
      roads, speed limits, traffic lights and road curvature.
