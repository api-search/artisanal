  Here at Oxford Dictionaries, home of the OED, we love words. That’s why we
  have experienced lexicographers tracking the living language, delving deep
  into our corpora and monitoring a wide range of media in order to understand
  how words are being used and how language is evolving. This research is used
  by our editors to write and edit dictionary entries and translations, meaning
  we’re able to offer up-to-date, accurate, and reliable lexical content in
  multiple languages.
