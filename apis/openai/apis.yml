  description: We’re releasing an API for accessing new AI models developed by OpenAI.
    Unlike most AI systems which are designed for one use-case, the API today provides
    a general-purpose “text in, text out” interface, allowing users to try it on virtually
    any English language task. You can now request access in order to integrate the
    API into your product, develop an entirely new application, or help us explore
    the strengths and limits of this technology.
