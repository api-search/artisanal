  - name: OpenAI Assistants API
    description: >-
      The Assistants API allows you to build AI assistants within your own
      applications. An Assistant has instructions and can leverage models,
      tools, and knowledge to respond to user queries. The Assistants API
      currently supports three types of tools - Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and
      Function calling. In the future, we plan to release more OpenAI-built
      tools, and allow you to provide your own tools on our platform.

    description: >-
      The Audio API provides two speech to text endpoints, transcriptions and
      translations, based on our state-of-the-art open source large-v2 Whisper
      model.

    description: >-
      Given a list of messages comprising a conversation, the model will return
      a response., providing an AI chat interface you can use to engage with
      users.

  - name: OpenAI Chat Completions API
    description: >-
      Chat models take a list of messages as input and return a model-generated
      message as output. Although the chat format is designed to make multi-turn
      conversations easy, it’s just as useful for single-turn tasks without any
      conversation.

    description: >-
      Files are used to upload documents that can be used with features like
      Assistants and Fine-tuning. Upload a file that can be used across various
      endpoints. The size of all the files uploaded by one organization can be
      up to 100 GB.

    description: >-
      Manage fine-tuning jobs to tailor a model to your specific training data.
      Creates a fine-tuning job which begins the process of creating a new model
      from a given dataset.Response includes details of the enqueued job
      including job status and the name of the fine-tuned models once complete.

    description: >-
      Learn how to generate or manipulate images with DALL·E in the API. The
      Images API provides three methods for interacting with images - creating
      images from scratch based on a text prompt, creating edited versions of
      images by having the model replace some areas of a pre-existing image,
      based on a new text prompt, Creating variations of an existing image.
