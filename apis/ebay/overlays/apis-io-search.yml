  eBay offers developers a wide range of RESTful and Traditional APIs. For new
  development, eBay strongly encourages the use of our RESTful APIs. A key
  benefit of REST is that it uses less bandwidth and supports multiple formats
  including plain text, XML, HTML, and JSON while SOAP only supports XML.
