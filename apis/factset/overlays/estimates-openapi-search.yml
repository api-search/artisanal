        <p>The rolling behavior causes fiscal year to automatically roll from
        one year to the next as the historical perspective date changes. The
        fiscal period rolls forward as of each period end. This endpoint is
        optimized to allow the request to simply include a relative fiscal
        period (e.g. use relativeFiscalStart integer 1 and periodicity ANN for
        next unreported fiscal year end), and then see what the consensus
        thought the "next fiscal year" estimates were through time as you "roll"
        back your perspective dates. This differs from locking down an absolute
        estimate period such as explicitly stating Fiscal Year 2019. This can be
        done in the fixed-consensus endpoint.</p>
