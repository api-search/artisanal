  /factset-benchmarks/v1/ratios:

      tags:
        - Index Level
      summary: Returns the aggregated ratios of a requested benchmark
      description: >
        Retrieves the index level ratios for a requested benchmark. Ratios
        supported are expressed through metrics parameter, and include
        Categories of Profitability, Valuation, Coverage, and Leverage. <p>
        Using FactSet Market Aggregates, the service combines fundamental,
        estimates, and pricing content to derive ratios and per share values for
        global equity market indexes and commercial benchmark vendors. The
        constituents of the index are fetched on rolling basis over time period
        requested, and then the metric requested is aggregated up to the index
        level. To learn more about FMA, visit [OA
        15778](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/15778).</p>

      summary: >-
        Returns a sample list of Benchmark Identifiers and the benchmark
        categorization to use in other Benchmark API endpoints.
      tags:
        - Helper
      description: >-
        Returns a **sample** list of Benchmark Identifiers to use in other
        Benchmark API endpoints. This is a supporting API to be use alongside
        the other Benchmark API endpoints. For example, use the fsymID value
        returned in this response as the input to your `ids` parameter in the
        /constituents endpoint to return constituents for that id.<p> *This is
        not the full list of benchmark ids allowed in this service, but rather a
        representation of the most commonly requested. For complete assistance
        with ID lookup or concordance services, please reach out to FactSet
        Support. *</p>
