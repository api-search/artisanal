  - name: Paypal Billing Subscriptions API
    description: >-
      You can use billing plans and subscriptions to create subscriptions that
      process recurring PayPal payments for physical or digital goods, or
      services. A plan includes pricing and billing cycle information that
      defines the amount and frequency of charge for a subscription. You can
      also define a fixed plan, such as a $5 basic plan or a volume- or
      graduated-based plan with pricing tiers based on the quantity purchased.
      For more information, see <a href=\"/docs/subscriptions/\">Subscriptions
      Overview</a>.
